I am sure that most of them have someone who's so close that the idea of them leaving, will makes you go nuts.

Everything comes with it's own pros and cons, but getting close to someone has some very different pros and cons. I am not going to discuss about those, but I am going to tell on how I am being effected.

If you are someone whos got a lot of mood swings, believe me, this thing will make you want to die. Why?. Your mood starts depending on how they react to what you say, how thier mood is. Every you will change to YOU BOTH. Its not always going to be bad, but if its going to be a bad mood, it ends up being the worst mood. Same goes with happiness, if your mood is amaze and thiers too, that ends up being the best mood.

All my life, I had no best friend, or someone whose close to me. Suddenly I meet this person, got to know a lot about each other, and boom we are best friends. I have no idea when did that happen. I am so happy that I finally have someone to share my thoughts with.

I suffer with anxiety, I get anxious over little things that normal people won't even bother. Think about my anxiety over this person.

I could go on on and write the things which I am scared of just because this person got close to me, but if I tell whats the best things happening. I will just answer with a single word - "PARADISE" with a little hell

I love you all.
