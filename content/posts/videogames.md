Video games, one of the things parents are most scared off. Most of the parents think video games will increase violence in their child's' life, or affect their mental health making them vulnerable. However, that might just be based on fallacious reasoning.

Video games might be the one thing that would help a child grow better. How? the strategy one makes to win a game is amazing. As a child, when playing a video game, he/she often will be baffled as the levels get harder, and this makes him think in a different way to achieve the goal, per se, completion of the level.

These electronic games help the child building reflexes. Some of the games require fast hand movements and rapid thinking to make a decision. These movements and decisions end up increasing the child's reflex and will work as a major plus in the future.

Another benefit of playing video games is gaining mental stability. One who plays video games gets mental stability easier than the one who doesn't. The question here is "How does one get mental stability while playing games?". Mental stability includes: How one receives defeat, How one controls their anger in some situations, How can someone think with a lot of pressure. These things can easily be achieved just by playing video games. 

Defeat is one thing that is common in any video game. In addition to this, the levels are already pretty challenging. So, one would simply give up, but he/she will again play this because they like to achieve the end reward which will be very appealing. This makes them grow up with accepting defeats while controlling their anger. Giving up on a defeat ends with rage quitting the game. This will take time but ends up with something that will help grow in their respective lives.

Games also help in working under pressure. It's simple. Games are hard. Even though one has the difficulty set to easy, it's very demanding. It will need the child to think of strategy while under pressure. As most of them won't be pausing the game mid-fight.
Also, the responsiveness is required to work. They need to work fast while thinking of a strategy while working under pressure. As a consequence of this, it helps the child do quickly while taking pressure.

Additional to all this, kids will increase their memory and accuracy exponentially. Games demand high accuracy and high memory skills. And this is the easiest way any child would be getting those skills at an earlier time in their lives. Games have to been played fast while having accuracy and memorizing the past given details. 

Multi-tasking. Video games 'are' multi-tasking, because any mission/level you play requires one to concentrate on one thing while doing others. This will also help in increasing hand-eye coordination. While also building the short-term memory, as they have to estimate where it would be appearing next. This will also help in increasing their estimation skills.

Especially multi-player games, help the child make new friends. If the child is having trouble having friends or making friends, games would be a tool that will help him/her make new friends and learn with them. Games also help to have quality time with their parents. Parents also need some time off their busy schedule, and games that are very fun and helpful help increase parent-child relationships.

All of this might seem very little at the beginning, but it will help the child learn a lot and help him/her grow into a better person in the future without them even noticing the impact of games on their lives.

Everything comes with its pros. And surely everything does have some sets of cons. The same thing goes to very helpful Games but surely does turn into something very horrible without guidance. Well, that doesn't mean one should stop giving access to playing games. The parent surely plays an important role particularly in this. Parents should give them the freedom to learn while restricting them to do anything illegal.
